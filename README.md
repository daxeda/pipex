# pipexeval

In the pipex project, I'm tasked with creating a simplified version of a shell command commonly
used in Unix-like operating systems. The challenge revolves around replicating the functionality of the command:

```bash
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```

This intricate command takes the output of `cmd1`, feeds it as input to `cmd2`, and ultimately redirects the final
output to `file2`. My mission involves implementing this behavior using the C programming language and leveraging 
the system calls provided by the Unix operating system.

Throughout this project, I'm diving deep into the intricacies of process creation, inter-process communication using pipes, 
and the nuances of file input/output redirection. It's a hands-on experience that allows me to gain a profound understanding 
of these fundamental concepts within the Unix environment.
